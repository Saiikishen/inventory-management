This document outlines the design, features, and implementation details of the chargeMOD R&D Inventory Management System. The application is built using React and Firebase, providing a secure and efficient platform for managing electronic components.

## Styling and Design

### Color Scheme

- **Primary:** Orange (`#FF8C00`)
- **Secondary:** Black (`#000000`)
- **Background:** Light Gray (`#f0f2f5`), White (`#ffffff`)
- **Text:** Dark Gray (`#333`)

### Typography

- **Font Family:** 'Montserrat', sans-serif (Applied globally)
- **Logo Font:**
    - "charge": Thin weight, black color
    - "MOD": Bold weight, orange color

### Layout

- **Login/Sign-up Pages:** Centered form layout with a clean and focused design.
- **Home Page:** A modern two-column layout:
    - **Left Panel:** Branding, welcome message, and an orange gradient background.
    - **Right Panel:** Interactive elements (search, category browsing).
- **Navbar:** A clean, horizontal layout with the logo on the left and navigation links on the right.
- **Component Catalog Page:** A full-page layout with a white background for a clean and spacious feel.
- **Transactions Page:** A centered, card-based layout with a clean and modern design.

## Features

### Authentication

- **Email Restriction:** Only users with a `@chargemod.com` email address can sign up.
- **Email Verification:** New users must verify their email address before they can log in.
- **Secure Sign-in:** Standard email and password authentication.

### Inventory Management

- **Component Search:** Users can search for components by their unique ID.
- **Category Browsing:** Components are organized into categories for easy browsing.
- **Real-time Availability:** The system provides real-time information on component quantities.
- **Standardized Component ID:** The unique ID for each component is automatically generated by capitalizing all letters and replacing spaces with underscores from the user-provided category, name, value, footprint, and tolerance rating.
- **Initial Quantity:** Users can set the initial quantity of a component when adding it to the inventory.

## Current Plan

### Add Initial Quantity Field (Completed)

- **Objective:** To add a "Quantity" field to the "Add Component" section to allow users to set the initial stock quantity when creating a new component.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `ComponentList.jsx` file has been updated to include a "Quantity" input field in the "Add Component" form.
    - The `handleAddComponent` function has been modified to save the initial quantity to Firestore.
- **Fix:**
    - Resolved a React warning in the snackbar by correcting the `handleCloseSnackbar` function to prevent passing invalid properties to the DOM element.

### Component Catalog Metric Addition (Completed)

- **Objective:** To add a "Quantity" metric to the Component Catalog page to display the available stock for each component.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `ComponentList.jsx` file has been updated to include a "Quantity" column in the component table, displaying the `component.quantity` value (defaulting to 0).
    - The `ComponentList.css` file has been updated to style the new "Quantity" column.

### Transactions Page UI Upgrade (Completed)

- **Objective:** To improve the UI of the Transactions page to be more aesthetically pleasing.
- **Implementation:**
    - The Material-UI components have been replaced with standard HTML elements.
    - A new stylesheet, `TransactionsPage.css`, has been created to style the page with a more modern design.
    - The layout has been restructured for a cleaner and more intuitive user experience.
- **Fix:**
    - Resolved a React warning by ensuring the `disabled` attribute in `TransactionsPage.jsx` receives a boolean value.
    - Resolved a persistent React warning by correcting the `disabled` attribute on the search button in `TransactionsPage.jsx` to accept a string value instead of a boolean.

### Home Page Styling (Completed)

- **Objective:** To apply the same orange gradient from the Sign In page to the Home page's left panel.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `HomePage.css` file has been updated to include the `linear-gradient` background and the text color has been adjusted for readability.

### Font Update (Completed)

- **Objective:** To update the application's font to a more modern and classy style.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `src/index.css` file has been updated to import and apply the "Montserrat" font from Google Fonts.

### Font Standardization (Completed)

- **Objective:** To ensure a consistent font is used across the entire application.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `font-family` declaration has been moved from `HomePage.css` to `src/index.css` and applied globally to the `body` element.
    - The redundant font declaration has been removed from `HomePage.css`.

### Component Catalog Standardization and Styling (Completed)

- **Objective:** To enforce a standard format for component IDs and improve the visual design of the Component Catalog.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `ComponentList.jsx` file has been updated to include a function that formats the component ID by converting all characters to uppercase and replacing spaces with underscores.
    - A new `ComponentCatalogPage.jsx` has been created to provide a full-page, white background for the component list.
    - The routing in `App.jsx` has been updated to use the new `ComponentCatalogPage`.
    - The `Components.jsx` file has been deleted as it is no longer needed.
- **Styling:**
    - The Material-UI components in `ComponentList.jsx` have been replaced with standard HTML elements and styled with a new `ComponentList.css` file for a more consistent and modern design.
    - A stubborn text color issue in the component list table has been resolved by applying an inline style with `!important` to ensure the text is always a dark, readable color.
